# Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction
Box Office Revenue Prediction Using Linear Regression in ML

ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
When a movie is produced, one of the key goals for the director and producers is to maximize box office revenue. In this project, we explore how machine learning can be used to predict a movieâ€™s box office revenue based on its genre and other relevant features such as release date, number of theaters, runtime, and MPAA rating.

By training models on historical movie data, this project aims to uncover patterns and relationships that influence a film's commercial success.
