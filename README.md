# Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction
Box Office Revenue Prediction Using Linear Regression in ML

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using Linear Regression to accurately predict the box office revenue of movies based on various available features. The model will be trained on a dataset containing historical movie data and will aim to identify key factors that impact revenue. By implementing data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization and model evaluation techniques, this project seeks to:
- Build a predictive model that can estimate the expected revenue of a movie prior to its release.
- Provide insights into which features most influence box office success.
- Compare linear regression performance with more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost) to assess predictive accuracy.
